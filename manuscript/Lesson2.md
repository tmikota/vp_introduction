### 1. Downloading from Quixel Bridge

**Summary:** To design landscapes in Unreal Engine, we first need a **material**. Some materials are available in the **Starter Content** folder of your Unreal Engine project. You can also use Megascans from Quixel Bridge, which are free to download. Bridge offers high-definition 3D scans of surface materials, plants, and assets. Before opening Bridge, make sure your Unreal Engine project is already open.
