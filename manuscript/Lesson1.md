**Summary:** In Unreal Engine, movement works like most PC games. The mouse controls where the camera looks, and the WASD keys control the movement.

**Looking Left, Right, Up, and Down**

1. **Hold Right Click** in the Viewport.
2. Drag the mouse in any direction.

**Moving**

1. Hold Right Click in the Viewport.
2. Move with WASD.

### 4. Placing Actors

**Summary:** An actor is any object that can be placed into a level. A Level is a workspace that contains everything that can be seen and interacted with. A blank project automatically starts you out with a level titled Main.

**Transform a Cube**

1. In the Place Actors window, click and drag a **Cube** into the Viewport.

2. Select the Cube. The **Red, Green, and Blue Arrows** are for moving the cube.

3. Hold left click on the **blue arrowhead** and drag UP to move the actor along the Z axis.

**Rotate a Cube**

1. With the actor selected, **press E** on the keyboard.

2. **Left click and drag** the red, green, or blue arcs to rotate the actor.

**Scale a Cube**

1. With the actor selected, press R on the keyboard.
   ![Press R](16r.PNG)
2. Cycle between Transform, Rotation, and Scale, using **Spacebar**. 
3. In the Scale mode, stretch an actor on a single axis by cicking and dragging the red, green, or blue cube.

**Quick Tip:** Undo with **CTRL Z** and Redo with **CTRL Y**.   

### Downloading from the Marketplace

**Summary:** Many free assets can be downloaded from the Marketplace in the Epic Games Launcher. The Animation Starter Pack will give us the default UE4 Mannequin. Putting the mannequin in your level can give you a reference for how you scale the rest of your environment.

**Download the Animation Starter Pack**

1. Epic Games Launcher > Unreal Engine Marketplace
2. Search **Animation Starter Pack**.
   ![Marketplace](19marketplace.PNG)
3. Download and **Add to Project**.

2. Content Browser > AnimationStarterPack > UE4_Mannequin > Mesh > SK_Mannequin
   ![Mannequin Filepath](21Mannequinfilepath.PNG)
